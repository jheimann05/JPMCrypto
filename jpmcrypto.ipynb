    "# For Reviewers:\n",
    "The purpose of our tutorial is to show how to make data-informed investment decisions through visualizing and analyzing past trends in cryptocurrencies and index fund(s). Our target users are beginner investors who are interested in crypto markets but have limited coding experience. We assume that the user will have a basic understanding of Python but limited exposure to data science. Our tutorial will address user needs like having accessibility of financial data analysis and practical decision making tools. Beginners will struggle to gather, clean, and visualize data so we will be providing step-by-step instructions for doing so. Also through seeing risk and reward tradeoffs and making a predictive AI model, users will gain skills in comparing assets and products and be able to experiment with financial strategies like holding and buying. Our tutorial will focus on data based coding while ensuring that users learn the concepts of financial data analysis and the workflows necessary to implement and visualize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The priorties for things to review at the high level would be our graphs. Our priorities is to make the graph(s) as clear as possible and the data cleaning step. We are also not sure if the numpy and pandas methods that we use are too advanced for our target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whats Done: We implemented getting the cryptocurrency data from an API, cleaning the data, calculaing the risk/reward from that data, graphing the data, and scheduling it so that the pipeline runs everyday at 9 am.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whats missing/left to do is that we wanted to add an interactive element to the graph so that you can over specific dates on the graph and be able to see that days closing price/violatility. Additionally we still need write the call for an OpenAI LLM to give advice based on the prices/violatility. Finally, we still need to change the code so that multiple/different coins can be used instead of just bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes: All of the requirement libraries are listed above. For the scheduling code, you can change 09:00 to next closest minute in order to test that segment of code. \n",

    "Risk/Return\n",
    "This risk/return function uses the Sharpe Ratio, which is a widely-accepted formula for evaluating the risk of buying a cryptocurrency. The function takes in an array of prices and a risk-free return value. The risk free-rate (rf) is the percentage return you can earn by investing in a Treasury Bill instead of bitcoin. As of November 16, 2025, the rf is 3.89%. You can find this value by going to the US department of treasury website, under the “Daily Treasury Bill Rate” section. Since we are looking at bitcoin data from the past 3 months, we will look at the “Coupon Equivalent” values for 13 weeks (As shown in the image below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our function body, we first calculate the daily returns and store these values in an array called returns. With that, we can calculate the risk by taking the standard deviation of the returns array and calculate the reward by taking the mean of the returns array. The final risk/reward ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the reward, then dividing that value by the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do these risk/reward values mean? A negative risk/reward value indicates this investment should be avoided because it is very risky and has low reward potential. Risk/reward ratios in the 0.0-0.99 range indicate a safe investment. Most investments fall in the 1.0-1.99 range and these offer a balance between risk and reward. A ratio above 2 suggests use of leverage to inflate returns, which also increases the risk. Thus, we encourage investors to conduct further research on such investments."

Finally, we calculate the volatility for bitcoin by multiplying every standard deviation by the square root of the number of trading days in a year (for cryptocurrencies this value is 365 since crypto can be traded 24/7). We also multiply each of these values by 100 so that we can represent volatility as percentages. We also round each volatility value to 2 using python's round function, which takes in the number we want to round and the length of the fractional part. We store these volatility values in the crypto_volatility array and return this array as the output to the volatility function."
