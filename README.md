# JPMCrypto

The purpose of our tutorial is to show how to make data-informed investment decisions through visualizing and analyzing past trends in cryptocurrencies and index fund(s). Our target users are beginner investors who are interested in crypto markets but have limited coding experience. We assume that the user will have a basic understanding of Python but limited exposure to data science. Our tutorial will address user needs like having accessibility of financial data analysis and practical decision making tools. Beginners will struggle to gather, clean, and visualize data so we will be providing step-by-step instructions for doing so. Also through seeing risk and reward tradeoffs and making a predictive AI model, users will gain skills in comparing assets and products and be able to experiment with financial strategies like holding and buying. Our tutorial will focus on data based coding while ensuring that users learn the concepts of financial data analysis and the workflows necessary to implement and visualize them.
